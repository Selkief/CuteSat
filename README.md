-

Flightcampaign at Kjell Hendriksen Observatory, Svalbard as a semester project at UNIS. 

Project name: "CuteSat", projectpartner: Victoria Bauer

Objective: to assemble a CanSat, calibrate the sensors and take measurements during descend with a parachute from about 120m above ground.

Variables measured: temperature (direct), temperature via NTC, humidity, pressure, position (GNSS), orientation/attitude.
The files contain some test measurements, the calibrations and the results of the campaign.
